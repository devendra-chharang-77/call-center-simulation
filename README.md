# Call Center Simulation

This project simulates call center operations using Poisson arrival and Exponential service times. It analyzes queue length, waiting times, and agent utilization.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Features
- Simulates incoming calls for 8-hour shifts
- Single vs multi-agent comparison
- Visualizes call patterns and wait time
