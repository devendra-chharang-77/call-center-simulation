 Call Center Simulation (Poisson Arrivals & Exponential Service)
This project simulates call center operations using a discrete event simulation model. It provides deep insights into queue dynamics, agent utilization, customer waiting time, and how resource allocation (like number of agents) affects performance.

Objective:-
To simulate a real-world call center environment and analyze how factors like call arrival rates, service times, and number of agents impact:
Average waiting time
Queue length
Agent utilization
Customer experience

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
NumPy (random simulation of Poisson/Exponential)
Matplotlib (data visualization)
SimPy (if used – else ignore)

 Key Features:-
 Simulates incoming calls for an 8-hour working day
 Supports single-agent vs multi-agent scenarios
 Measures key metrics:
 • Average and maximum queue length
 • Average and peak wait times
 • Agent busy time vs idle time
 Clear, easy-to-understand graphs and visualizations

 Sample Visuals:-
Add some screenshots or sample plots showing queue length, agent utilization, or waiting time graphs.
