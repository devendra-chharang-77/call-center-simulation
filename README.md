# call-center-simulation
Task 1: Setting Up the Call Center Simulation-
 Objective - 
Define the environment for the call center simulation — including how often calls arrive, how many calls an agent can handle, and how long the simulation will run.

1 Steps Performed
 Imported Required Libraries
     NumPy for simulating randomness
     Matplotlib for visualizing results
2 Defined Call Arrival Rate (λ)
      20 calls/hour
Represents the incoming call traffic
3 Defined Service Rate (μ)
      5 calls/hour per agent
      Represents agent capacity-
4 Defined Simulation Time
      8 hours shift
5 Simulates a complete workday-
     Ensured Reproducibility
     Set a fixed seed for random number generator
So the same results appear each time the simulation is run

 Why This Step Matters
This step lays the foundation of the simulation. Without setting these basic parameters, we can't model or analyze the call center's performance.
